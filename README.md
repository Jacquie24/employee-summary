  ### Description
  The goal of this project was to create a Command Line Interface that enables the user to create a team profile by entering various team members and their information, such as name, email address, and job role.  The team info is then generated on an html page.  This app combined HTML, Javascript, and Nodejs functions to make it work seamlessly.

Once all questions have been answered and the user responds they do not wish to add any more team members, then an html page is generated.
